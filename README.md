# CARRY

## About Carry
<strong>Carry</strong> is a Car Sharing System where Agents can talk to Master Server via socket connection to allow customers to have access, as well as a Flask web application is deployed on the server in another thread simultaneously. The web application has two different parts, one for customers where they can search cars, book and manage their bookings, and the other part is for employees where managers can see visulisation graphs indicating business status to help them to make a business decision, admins can maintain the data regarding the system, and engineers are able to check out reported cars and find the car's location. <br /><br />
<strong>Agent</strong> is based on a console-based system, which allows customers to log in with either their credentials and facial recognition. It also has features for engineers such as Bluetooth Auto Connection and QR Code Reader, so that the engineers can easily finish their jobs. The applications are built by using
